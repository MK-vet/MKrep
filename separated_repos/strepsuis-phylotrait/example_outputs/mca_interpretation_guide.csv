Aspect,Interpretation
Column Points,"Column points represent binary features (MIC, AMR, Virulence genes). Their position shows correlation with other features."
Row Points,Row points represent strains. Proximity between points indicates similar trait profiles.
Proximity (Columns),Features close together tend to co-occur in the same strains.
Proximity (Rows),Strains close together share similar genetic trait profiles.
Row-Column Relationship,Strains positioned near certain features are more likely to possess those features.

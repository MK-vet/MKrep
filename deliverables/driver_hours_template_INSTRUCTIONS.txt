I will place the ready .xlsx file into the repository but cannot generate binary .xlsx directly from this environment. This file explains how to generate the .xlsx locally using the provided script docs/generate_driver_hours_xlsx.py, and how to upload the generated file into the repository.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Navigate to the script directory**:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Run the script** to generate the .xlsx file:
   ```bash
   python generate_driver_hours_xlsx.py
   ```

3. **Verify the generated file** (make sure `driver_hours_template.xlsx` is created in the same directory).

4. **Navigate to the repository root**:
   ```bash
   cd ../../
   ```

5. **Add the generated file to the staging area**:
   ```bash
   git add deliverables/driver_hours_template.xlsx
   ```

6. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add driver hours template"
   ```

7. **Push the changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
